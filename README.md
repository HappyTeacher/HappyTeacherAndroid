# Happy Teacher 
### A lesson plan platform for teachers in India.

There are many syllabuses in the Indian education system, distributed by state or national governments' Education Boards. While the structure of these syllabuses may differ, the underlying content is the same. One syllabus may suggest teaching a certain topic at the 9th Standard level, whereas a different syllabus may suggest teaching it at the 8th Standard level.

Happy Teacher connects Indian education board syllabuses to the topics that make up their lesson plans in an effort to provide a single source of content that applies to different education contexts in India. 

Lesson plans for a given topic can be written by any teacher and submitted through the app.
